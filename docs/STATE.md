## 📍 CURRENT STATE (overwrite this block; keep tight)

- **Last done:** the Phase 3 cart — `src/stores/cart.ts` (nanostores + persist), `POST /api/cart`
  (server-side pricing, stock clamping, correction notices), and the `/cart` page — plus polish on
  top: the mobile menu (`SiteHeader.astro`) now animates open/closed and overlays the page instead of
  an instant cut that pushed content down, with centered link text; and the product page's «Додати до
  кошика» no longer confirms with a toast — it opens a cart popup (`src/components/CartPopup.astro`,
  `src/lib/cartPopup.ts`, mounted once in `BaseLayout`), a centered modal listing every cart line,
  the total, and «Оформити замовлення», fetched fresh from `/api/cart` (now shared via
  `src/lib/cart/client.ts`, also used by `/cart`) and converged back into the store the same way
  `/cart` does. Replaces the toast entirely — `src/lib/toast.ts` and `src/components/Toast.astro` are
  deleted. Popup also now surfaces `/api/cart`'s stock-clamp notices (repeatedly clicking «Додати» past
  what's in stock previously just silently stopped incrementing) — same `data-notices` /
  `cartNoticeText()` pattern `/cart` already used, now shared into the popup too. All uncommitted.
- **In progress:** Phase 3. The cart is done; **`/checkout` does not exist yet, so the cart's
  «Оформити замовлення» button 404s** — it is the next thing built, not a bug to chase.
  Phase 2 still carries its own leftover: the seven static pages render a heading, a lead and a
  `ContentPlaceholder`. Writing them is a Phase 5 content item, and the legal ones gate Monobank.
- **Next step:** `/checkout` — the form, order creation with a stock reservation inside a
  transaction, then the Monobank invoice. `/api/cart` is what checkout revalidates against, so the
  two cannot disagree about what a cart is worth.
- **Blockers (waiting on me):**
  - Phase 0 externals, all outside our control: Monobank Acquiring registration, Nova Poshta
    business account + cash-on-delivery setup, Telegram manager account / bot / chat.
    **Checkout runs into all three**, unlike the cart, which needed none of them.
  - `DATABASE_URL` must exist as an **encrypted Secret** on the `balier-dev` Worker. On
    2026-08-03 `wrangler secret list` returned `[]` and every DB-backed route 500ed. Local dev
    reads `.dev.vars` and works, so this only bites the deployed site.
    <!-- TODO: confirm whether this has since been set. -->
  - `PUBLIC_TELEGRAM_MANAGER` in `wrangler.jsonc` is a **placeholder handle**.
- **Active branch:** `main` (only branch; tracks `origin/main`). A push to `main` deploys.

## ✅ Phase tracker (high-level; detail in docs/plans/roadmap.md)

## 🗒️ SESSION LOG (newest first; 3–6 lines each)

### 2026-08-03 — cart popup: show the stock-limit notice

- Did: the popup fetched `summary.notices` from `/api/cart` but never rendered them, so a customer
  repeatedly clicking «Додати до кошика» past what's in stock just saw the quantity stop climbing,
  with no explanation. Added the same `data-notices` list + `cartNoticeText()` rendering `/cart`
  already had, into `src/components/CartPopup.astro`, so a clamped or sold-out line now shows the
  same «у наявності лише N шт.» / «закінчився» copy the cart page shows.
- Decisions: reused `/cart`'s existing notice styling and copy verbatim rather than inventing
  popup-specific wording — one message for the same server-side event, wherever it's shown.
- Verified: `pnpm check` (0 errors) and `pnpm build` both pass. Not eyeballed live in a browser —
  worth triggering a clamp by hand (add past stock) before/along with `/checkout`.
- Next: unchanged — `/checkout`.

### 2026-08-03 — add-to-cart popup replaces the toast

- Did: on request, swapped the add-to-cart toast for a Rozetka-style cart popup — higher expected
  purchase conversion than a passive confirmation. `src/components/CartPopup.astro` (centered modal;
  no existing anchored-popover pattern to extend, and centered works unchanged at 320px and desktop),
  `src/lib/cartPopup.ts` (`openCartPopup()`, same event-dispatch shape the toast used). Opens on
  add-to-cart, fetches `/api/cart` fresh, lists every line (image, title, variant, qty × price), the
  total, and «Оформити замовлення» → `/checkout`, plus a link to `/cart`. Converges the store to the
  server's answer (`replaceCart`) on every open, same as `/cart` itself.
- Decisions: extracted the `/api/cart` fetch the popup needed into `src/lib/cart/client.ts` and
  pointed `/cart`'s own fetch at it too, rather than duplicating it — one fetch, one error path.
  Background content gets `inert` while the popup is open (same technique `SiteHeader`'s mobile nav
  already uses) instead of a hand-rolled focus trap; focus returns to the button that opened it.
  `src/lib/toast.ts` and `src/components/Toast.astro` deleted — nothing else referenced them.
- Verified: `pnpm check`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` all pass; traced the served module graph through
  the dev server to confirm the popup's script and the product page's `openCartPopup()` call both
  resolve with no import errors. No browser automation tool was available this session, so the
  open/close animation, focus return and backdrop dismissal have not been eyeballed live — worth a
  manual check before/along with `/checkout`.
- Next: unchanged — `/checkout`.

### 2026-08-03 — mobile menu polish

- Did: `SiteHeader.astro`'s mobile nav panel — was `hidden`/instant show-hide and pushed `<main>`
  down while open. Now: `absolute` against the sticky header (its containing block) so it overlays
  the page instead of growing the header's box; open/close animates via a `grid-rows-[0fr] → [1fr]`
  + opacity transition (300ms) instead of a display cut; `inert` toggled alongside so the collapsed
  links leave tab order without a `display: none` jump. Link text is centered (was left, briefly
  right, settled on center per direction mid-session).
- Verified: `pnpm check` passes (0 errors) after each edit. Not eyeballed live in a browser this
  session — worth a manual check on a real mobile viewport.
- Next: unchanged — `/checkout`.

### 2026-08-03 — add-to-cart toast

- Did: replaced the add-to-cart button's in-place «Додано ✓» label swap with a global toast —
  `src/lib/toast.ts` (`showToast()`, fires a `toast:show` DOM event) and `src/components/Toast.astro`
  (stacks, top-right, slide + fade in ~300ms, auto-dismisses ~2.6s, `role="status" aria-live="polite"`),
  mounted once in `BaseLayout.astro`. The product page now calls `showToast()` on add; the old
  sr-only `data-cart-status` region is gone since the toast's own live region covers that.
- Decisions: kept `showToast()` generic (not cart-specific) so any future action can reuse it.
- Verified: `pnpm check` and `pnpm build` pass; confirmed the rendered markup via `pnpm dev` + curl.
  No browser automation tool was available this session, so the slide/fade motion itself has not
  been eyeballed live — worth a quick manual check.
- Next: unchanged — `/checkout`.

### 2026-08-03 — Phase 3, part 1: the cart

- Did: `src/lib/cart/` (pure totals + clamping), `src/lib/validation/cart.ts`,
  `src/lib/db/queries/cart.ts`, `src/stores/cart.ts`, `POST /api/cart`, `/cart`, the header badge,
  and the product page's «Додати до кошика». Vitest added (`pnpm test`, 22 tests on the totals).
- Decisions: open decision 1 closed — the recipient pays Nova Poshta's tariff, so the site never
  quotes delivery and `deliveryTotal` is always 0. Adding keeps the customer on the product page and
  confirms in the button. `QuantityStepper` switched to delegated listeners so cloned cart rows work.
- Verified against Neon at 320 px and 1280 px: clamping, sold-out, malformed storage, a blocked
  `/api/cart` (error state + retry), and a burst of «+» collapsing into one revalidation.
- Next: `/checkout`. Its CTA on `/cart` 404s until then.

### 2026-08-03 — docs reorganization

- Did: created `docs/` (STATE / OVERVIEW / CONVENTIONS / plans), `git mv`'d `roadmap.md` to
  `docs/plans/roadmap.md`, and reduced `CLAUDE.md` to a router.
- Decisions: `roadmap.md` keeps its filename so the bare-filename references in source comments
  still read correctly; the file now lives at exactly one path.
- Next: continue with Phase 3, or correct anything mis-inferred in the block above.

### 2026-08-03 — Phase 2 build

- Did: homepage, `/products`, `/products/[slug]`, `/products/category/[slug]`, `/search`, `404`,
  seven static-page placeholders; R2 media pipeline and dev catalog ingest.
- Decisions: no EN/UA switcher, no newsletter signup, Telegram CTA is a plain deep link, images
  are never resized server-side. All recorded in `docs/plans/roadmap.md`.
- Next: Phase 3 (cart, checkout, Monobank webhook).
